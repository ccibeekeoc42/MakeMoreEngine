# MakeMoreEngine
In this repo, we explore an introduction to language modeling by building several language models. Please Enjoy!

### Software, Tools, and prerequisits
1. Access to Google Colab or some Jupyter Notebook.
2. Basic python programing.
3. Basic arithmetic & calculus knowledge.

### Intro: What is MakeMore Engine
As the name suggests, makemore is an engine that makes more of things given to it. For example, if trained on a list of names, MakeMore Engine would generate more unique name-like words based off what it learns from the training dataset (list of names provided). 

MakeMore is a character-level language model that treats each of its training examples as sequences of individual characters. This measn that given some characters in the sequence, it learns to predict the next character.

We would explore several autoregressive models from Bigrams to Transformers (like GPT) of this character level predictions namely:
